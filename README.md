# Sleep Disorder Diagnosis Using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

Overview

This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to classify individuals as having a sleep disorder or not, using health and lifestyle data. It proposes a cost-effective, accessible alternative to traditional sleep disorder diagnostic methods like Polysomnography (PSG).

Objectives

Accurately detect sleep disorders using machine learning models.

Improve diagnostic accessibility and efficiency.

Implement ensemble models to enhance performance over traditional algorithms.
